# Uncommon C Bug: Undefined Behavior with Pointers

This repository demonstrates a subtle but potentially problematic C code snippet.  The code appears correct at first glance, but it carries the risk of undefined behavior due to pointer manipulation. 

The bug is highlighted in `bug.c`. The solution, which addresses the root cause of the undefined behavior, is provided in `bugSolution.c`.

This example serves as a reminder of the importance of careful pointer handling in C programming to prevent unexpected crashes and erratic behavior.
